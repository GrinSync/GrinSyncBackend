    <h2>For Students, Staff, Faculty, and the Community!</h2>
    <p>For students and Grinnell employees, feel free to make a verified account with your Grinnell email, but
if you're part of the larger Grinnell Community, or just visiting, feel free to use the app as a guest knowing 
that you'll still see all public events!
    </p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <p>We auto-populate events from Grinnell's <a href="https://events.grinnell.edu/">Events Calendar</a>
        but also allow users to create their own events or claim the auto-populated events. Students can join organizations
        to host events and allow multiple people editing access.</p>
    <p>Events have tags, like <code>Sports</code>, <code>Arts</code>, and the ever popular <code>Food Provided</code>. 
        Users set their own interests, so the upcoming events we show are only ones you'll actually be interested in!
        Feeling adventerous? The search and calendar pages allow you to see events with different tags or just show everything
        people have scheduled!
    </p>
    <p>Event creators can mark events as <code>Student Only</code>, meaning they'll not show up publicly or for anyone without
    a Grinnell student email, so don't worry about your visiting family showing up to a High St. rager!</p>
