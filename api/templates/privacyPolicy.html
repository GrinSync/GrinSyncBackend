<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The basic functionality of GrinSync requires us to store each user&#39;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of identifying hosts and allowing the app to be customized when you log in.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Primarily for initial account verification, but also to allow users to contact you about events you host. Your email will never be shared without your permission, but by creating an event, you agree to publicize your email so that other users may contact you. Once a user has decided to make their email public, GrinSync&#39;s promise of email privacy is no longer applicable.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Community Status</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the app&#39;s protections of students to function, we need to know if a user is a student, faculty, or non-college community member. This will be verified via email, and stored from them on out. Currently, the only way to change your status once an account has been created is to delete your current account and create a new one. We do not share a user&#39;s status, although it may be gleamed from app interactions, such as creating a student-only event.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Users&#39; liked events and followed organizations are strictly used for the internal filtering of events and not shared. We do <strong>not</strong> store any usage or other activity data.</p>
<p>Individuals that are 13 years old or younger are not permitted to create a GrinSync account. We will not store the data of any such individual.</p>
<p>Any user may have us completely erase all data we store about them by deleting their account at <a href="https://grinsync.com/deleteAccount/">https://grinsync.com/deleteAccount/</a></p>
